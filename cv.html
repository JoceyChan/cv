          Expanding my horizons was an outreach event held by SWE, in order for the younger generation to be inspired to become involved in the STEM field. I got to be a group leader for a group of K-12 students and went into depth about my major. Held a few hands-on STEM-related activities such as coding and got to inform them more about how networking is beneficial.
